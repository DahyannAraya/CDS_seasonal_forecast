# Seasonal Forecast Project

Welcome to the Seasonal Forecast Project, a comprehensive suite of Python scripts designed to harness the power of Copernicus seasonal forecasting data. This project provides a robust framework for accessing, processing, and analyzing seasonal climate forecasts, offering flexibility to meet a wide range of research and application needs.

## Features

- Flexible Data Access: Our scripts facilitate direct access to the rich dataset provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Users can easily adjust the geographic area of interest, ensuring that the data retrieved is perfectly tailored to their study region.

- Customizable Time Frames: Whether you're interested in historic overview of the forescast data or short/long-term forecasts, the scripts allow for precise adjustment of both the hincast period and the forecast horizon. This adaptability ensures that users can focus on the specific time windows that matter most to their analysis.

- Lag Adjustment: Understanding the lag in climate data is crucial for accurate forecasting. Our scripts provide the capability to adjust for lag in the data, enhancing the reliability of the forecasts used in your analysis.

- Heat Wave Definition: A key feature of our project is the predefined definition of heat wave days, based on temperature thresholds and duration. This definition is fully customizable, allowing users to tailor it according to their specific research needs or local climate conditions.

- Tailored to Specific Needs: Recognizing that each user's requirements are unique, our scripts are designed with customization in mind. Users have the ability to modify and adapt the scripts to fit their specific objectives, ensuring that the data retrieved and processed meets their exact needs.

- Integration with CLIMADA: The scripts provide a  seamless integration with the CLIMADA platform. The scripts are capable of converting Copernicus seasonal forecast data into heat wave days, which are then transformed into a Hazard object within CLIMADA. This allows for the estimation of potential impacts of forecasts on populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems, providing valuable insights into climate risk and vulnerability.

## Usage

The scripts are designed for ease of use, with clear documentation and examples provided to guide users through the process of accessing and analyzing seasonal forecast data. Whether you're a climate scientist, a policy maker, or someone with a keen interest in climate forecasting, our project offers the tools you need to derive meaningful insights from Copernicus data.
Customization

We understand that every study is unique. As such, we encourage users to explore the customization options available within the scripts. Detailed instructions on how to adjust geographic areas, time frames, lag, and heat wave definitions are provided, ensuring that you can tailor the analysis to your specific needs.
Conclusion

This frame represents a significant advancement in the accessibility and usability of Copernicus seasonal forecasting data for impact assessment. By providing a flexible, customizable framework for data retrieval and analysis, we aim to empower users to conduct detailed climate forecasts and impact assessments.
